    <p>On the 17th of October 2005 the first in a legendary series of podcasts compiled by DinsdaleP was broadcast. Every week or so , a new edition followed.</p>
    <p>They continued for 114  episodes until December the 11th 2007, an astonishing amount of material in such a short space of time and very hard work for the author who shared these with us.</p>
    <p>Dinsdale has very kindly made the original lossless tapes available to Nowhere Man Records, who are privileged to present them in their entirety, along with one or two surprises.</p>
    <p>Information about the content of each episode can be found in the following notes...we hope you enjoy listening to them as much as we enjoyed putting them together.</p>
